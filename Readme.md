### Proactive
- Love, the feeling, is the fruit of Love, the verb. So love her, serve her, listen to her, empathize, appreciate, affirm her.
- Love, the feeling, can be recaptured using Love, the verb
- Focus on Circle of Influence, but not on Circle of Concern.
- Have Courage to change the things which can and ought to be changed. Have serenity to accept the things which cannot be changed, and wisdom to know the difference.
- If you start to think the problem is "out there", stop yourself. That thought is the problem.
