## Private Victory
### Be Proactive
- Love, the feeling, is the fruit of Love, the verb. So love her, serve her, listen to her, empathize, appreciate, affirm her.
- Love, the feeling, can be recaptured using Love, the verb
- Focus on Circle of Influence, but not on Circle of Concern.
- Have Courage to change the things which can and ought to be changed. Have serenity to accept the things which cannot be changed, and wisdom to know the difference.
- If you start to think the problem is "out there", stop yourself. That thought is the problem.
- Be an agent, not a victim.
- Be the driver of your life, not the passenger.
- You cannot control everything that happens to you, but control what you do about it.

### Begin with end in mind
- All things are created twice. There's a mental or first creation, and a physical or second ceartion, to all things.
- Management is doing things right, Leadership is doing right things.
- Success is not in having things, but having mastery, victory over self.
- 

Put first things first
